About Us:
The Assassinâ€™s Creed Project team consists of four DIGIT majors, three seniors (Danny, Isaac, Josh) and one Junior (Anthony). The group holds a passion for video games along with a vast enjoyment for ancient history. This combined with the drive to learn more about how to share this story with the world made this game a no-brainer choice for the group. The group collectively enjoys playing video games, taking photos, and sharing stories with the world through our art. With a passion that has developed throughout the course (DIGIT 210), we have collectively discovered a new found enjoyment for data visualization.
