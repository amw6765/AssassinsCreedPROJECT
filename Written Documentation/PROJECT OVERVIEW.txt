AC Odyssey Writeup:
The Assassin’s Creed Project is built around the hit game from Ubisoft studios “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey”. The plot tells a mythological history of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Players control a male or female mercenary who fights on both sides of the conflict as they attempt to find their family.

This project appealed to our team for many reasons but the main reason is quite simple, this game is really cool. Who doesn't like a good sword fight or some parkour based in the ancient world? Alternatively, we chose this because it is of course of great interest to us, but there is just so much to unpack in the story. There is a figurative boat load of characters and events that take place that we were able to sift through and develop visuals for. 

For the technical parts of this project, we tried to give as much detail as possible while also beckoning for a user to dive in and find things out themselves. With our first two graphs, we used a few different series of data that was compiled into an svg based output that displays relationships between actions vs speakers, and speeches vs speakers. These are two good relationships to highlight because they provide for a broad output of data that tells a story while also making you want to learn more. These are a good segway into further exploration of the transcript. Our second visual in the project was built with spacy. With this graph, we wanted to make something that was more interactive and displayed the most prominent places and groups of people in the story. Our final piece is an interactive graph that displays the relationship between our main character (Alexios) and everybody else in the game. This graph is really in depth and interactive so you can really dive in and learn a lot about character relationships in this universe.
