<!--<h1>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h1>
        <h2>About Assassin's Creed</h2>
        <p>Assassin's Creed is an action role-playing video game. The game company Ubisoft Quebec both develops and publishes this game series. There are a total of 12 main games and seventeen spin-off games as well as several short films. Assassins Creed is available for play on all major gaming platforms.</p>
        <h2>Odyssey</h2>
        <p>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the 11th major installment, and the 21st overall, in the Assassin's Creed series. The game takes place in 431-422BC and recounts secret mythological histroy set during the Peloponnesian War. The player is able to choose between two main characters, Alexios and Kassandra.</p>
        <h2>The Project<h2>
        <p>We took the Assassins Creed Odyssey script (Alexios story line) and marked it up using Regex into XML. We wanted to try and find anything in the script that was not visable right away and translate it into something visual. With this in mind we took all of the speaking parts and action parts and seperating them into their own values to help find some interesting comparisons.</p>
